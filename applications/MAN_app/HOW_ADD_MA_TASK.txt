How to add a new MA task

1. Create your task inside the main folder MAN_app implenting the particular functionalities of your management application (MA) task
2. Go to hardware/sc/peripherals/app_injector.h and increase the value of macro MAN_APP_DESCRIPTOR_SIZE to +1
3. Go to common_includes and add new macros related to your MA task, follow the patter of the SDN task for example
4. Go to global_mapper.c and follow the steps:
  a) Create a myMAtask_ID_offset global variable, follows the SDN task pattern
  a) Into the map_management_tasks() search for the comments specifing how to instatiate new MA tasks
  b) Into the handle_i_am_alive(), search for the comments specifing how to instatiate new MA tasks
5. Your MA task needs to call the function initialize_MA_task() at main function.
6. Your MA task also need to implement the handling of the packet INITIALIZE_MA_TASK that is sent by the global_mapper initializing all MA tasks
Please implement the properly initialization of your MA task fullfilling this minimum step (you can observe the others initializiong funciton inside noc_manager):
  a) Create a loop that reads the ma_tasl_location (array sent by global mapper into the INITIALIZE_MA_TASK packet) and call the function AddTaskLocation for each task inside this array
  
This is all, hopefully your MA task will works fine after these steps.
